LIME2_initialï»¿ (internal)


LIME2-Rev.A (internal)
===========
1. GPIO4 pin 12 and pin 14 swapped to PA9 and PA14, to use in GMAC interface. Previous one were GPIO02, GPIO3 from AXP209. Now AXP signals are not used.
2. EMAC changed to GMAC
3. Add second DDR memory chip
4. USBDRV0 moved to PC17 (to free audio) EXT pinout changed
5. PB9 go to GPIO3
6. Power supply updated as in LIME REV.C
7. Add NA resistor between PC16/NWP of processor and PIN19 #WP of NAND

LIME2-Rev.B (pre-production)
===========
1. 32kHz crystal changed from PTH to SMD
2. LAN part updated as per A20-SOM-EVB-Rev.C - new LAN connector package, capacitor 1n/2kV to shield, separate polygone for LAN shield
3. GMAC PHY routing to differential 100 ohm impedance to the LAN connector
4. Add 4 NA resistors for PIO0..PIO3, for possible use of I2C3, I2C4
5. DDR3 package updated
6. Add two capacitors 47uF on USB host power and one 47uF to the USB OTG
7. R59 change from 13K to 6.8K to increase USB host current cut-off to 1A
8. L1, L2, L3 changed from FB/600R/0805 to 0R/0805
9. C175 changed to 6.8K/0402, R73 changed to 22uF/6.3V/0603 for soft power up. 
   C175 changed from 100n to 22uF/6.3V/0603, R73 changed from 4.99K/1% to 6.8K/0402 
   RC delay for HDD softstart power up
10. R34 changed from 1K to NA
11. R31 changed from NA to 470K
12. C111 changed from NA to 100n
13. VDD_RTC's label updated from 3V3/30mA to 1V3/30mA as is indeed.
   
LIME2-Rev.C (production)
============================
1. C175 change from 100n/0402 to 22uF/0603
3. Updated package of HDMI connector

LIME2-Rev.D (internal)
===============================
1. Add eMMC -> Optional(NAND or eMMC)
2. C224 and C232 -> 47uF/6.3V/0805 were added in parallel to the 5V_SATA_PWR connector;
3. Change L1, L2, L3 from FB/600R/0805 to 0R/0805.
4. Capacitors C84, C85 changed from 100nF/0402 to 22uF/0603;
5. New LAN routing.
6. EMMC_RST moved from PC4/NCE0/EMMC_RST to PC16/NWP/EMMC_RST

LIME2-Rev.E (internal)
==============================
1. PC17/USB0-DRV routing changed.
2. U15 and U17 updated from SY8008C(AA)C to SY8009AAAC(SOT23-5).

LIME2-Rev.F (internal)
==============================
1. PHY changed to RTL8211E-VB-CG1
2. Rx pullups moved before the serial matrix for better routing.

LIME2-eMMC-Rev.G (production)
==============================
1. Add four mount holes 3.3mm like on A20-olinuXino-Micro, connected to GND, odd milling shape changed to rectangular.
2. R109 change from 47k/0402 to 470k/0402, R107 changed from 470k/0402 to capacitor 220nF/0402, because new PHY surge too much current at startup.

LIME2-eMMC-Rev.H (internal)
==============================
1. Add C235 1uF/0603 for phy power up sequence (R107 now is NA).
2. R108 change to NA due to Ultimaker request.

LIME2-eMMC-Rev.I (internal)
==============================
1. LAN PHY change to KSZ9031 to allow industrial grade board production
