OLINUXINO - Single Board Linux Computer, Copyright(C) 2012, OLIMEX Ltd

THE PROJECT:

OLINUXINO is Open Source software and Open Source Hardware, low cost EUR 30 Linux Industrial grade single board computer with GPIOs capable to operate -25+85C. 
People keep comparing OLINUXINO with Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone project, so we would like to state the differences here:

Although the projects are similar there are different goals and implementations:

OLINUXINO is completely open source - including hardware and software, this means you have access to all CAD files and sources and you can reuse them for your own personal or commercial project.
There are NO restrictions to manufacture and sell these board for your own use or resale.
OLINUXINO use widely available microcontroller iMX233 which cost USD 5.50 in 100 pcs quantity, this means that people can spin off their own boards and manufacture them cheap as the processor is in TQFP easy to assembly by hobbyist package.

RASPBERRY PI have no released CAD files nor complete schematics, RPi uses processor from Broadcom which is not available for sale in small quantity, it uses BGA package which require expensive setup to assembly.
RPi is designed to be home gadget, OLINUXINO will work in industrial environment -25+85C and will be designed to be low cost but NOISE immune.

BeagleBone have open source CAD hardware files but uses BGA processor and BB board is very complex and hard to manufacture in small quantities.

OLINUXINO uses processor on 454Mhz and have less memory and will not allow fancy graphics, but this is not our intention.

To name few potential applications for OLINUXINO:

- 3D rep-rap printer controller including G-code interpreter - now all 3D printers use PC/Laptop connected to Arduino stepper driver, this board will handle both without problem
- Low cost PLC running open source PLC porgramming languages
- Home Automation - connecting GSM module or Zigbee sensors would be easy with the existing UEXT connector
- OLINUXINO have 100Mbit Ethernet port, but there are many low cost $10 WIFI USB modules with Linux drivers like RTL8192 which allow OLINUXINO to connect to internet wireless and to may control relays and sensors without need for LAN wiring.
- Having small linux module with GPIOs would be handy even to embed it in other products. BeagleBone do not allow the board to be used in commercial projects, there are no restrictions with OLINUXINO
