This example works with all Olimex Allwinner boards (A10, A13, A20) using the official Debian images.

Make sure to edit i2c.c to set the proper i2c interface. 
This is done in function I2C_Open(), where /dev/i2c-2 is set by default

To compile install gcc and build-essentials and type

# make

After that execute the program

# ./mod-io [param] [address] [data]


1) Set states of the digital outputs on the board
# ./mod-io -relay 0x58 0x0F	->	This will toggle the all 4 relays. 0x58 is the default address.

2) Get states of the digital inputs of the board. 
# ./mod-io -dig 0x58

3) Get the voltage applied to one of the analogue inputs of the board.
# ./mod-io -an1 0x58
# ./mod-io -an2 0x58
# ./mod-io -an3 0x58
# ./mod-io -an4 0x58

4) Set new slave address to the board.
# ./mod-io -address 0x58 <new>	->	At the moment of sending this command the BTN must be pressed.
